# Why This Site Exists And Why It Is Not Another Resume Clone

This site exists for one reason: to be my writing home. My resume already lives as a PDF, and my professional snapshot already lives on LinkedIn.

What I wanted was a space for the layer in between, where I can write reflections across different categories: projects, trends, lessons from work and school, and ideas that are too long for a social post but too useful to keep in my Notes app forever.

The workflow is simple. I share short highlights on platforms like LinkedIn, then point people here for the full version.

## Quick Intro: Who Am I?

I am currently a Master of Computer Science student at the University of Sydney, under a scholarship from Singapore IMDA.

Before postgrad, I worked for five years across two very different industries: semiconductor as a Data Scientist, and the secondhand car marketplace as a Machine Learning Engineer. So yes, my career path includes both silicon wafers and used cars. Technology is wonderfully weird.

## Why I Chose a Master of Computer Science

After graduating with a Bachelor of Aerospace Engineering from NTU, I moved into data science and then deeper into AI/ML.

My main reason for doing this master’s is simple: I wanted to create long-term leverage, not just short-term progression.

The biggest part is technical leverage. As a self-taught professional, I wanted to strengthen my CS fundamentals in a more systematic way and explore adjacent areas to build a broader view of how the industry fits together.

The second major part is strategic leverage. I wanted the headspace to take a real shot at tech entrepreneurship. People often say student life is easier than working life; as someone who has done both, I think the reality is more nuanced, and I will share that in another post. I am not a software engineer by title, but I built a small app business while studying full-time that served 7k+ users. That experience came with a lot of practical lessons, and I will unpack those in a separate write-up.

The smaller reason is credential leverage. Skills matter most in practice, but formal credentials still help in early hiring filters in Singapore, especially in round-one screening. I have experienced this firsthand: once, my resume reached the hiring manager through a connection, and the hiring manager was keen to interview me. The process still stopped at first-round screening because HR flagged that I did not have a formal CS qualification. Hopefully, this becomes less common as hiring shifts toward demonstrated skills and real-world impact.

## What You Can Expect Here

Expect practical reflections, clear takeaways, and the occasional humor when debugging life decisions. If any post is useful, share it. If not, at least now you know why this site exists.
