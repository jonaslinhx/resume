# Building My Resume Site

I wanted my personal site to be useful in under one minute.

## Why Resume-First

- Recruiters and collaborators can quickly understand my profile.
- Contact methods are visible at the top.
- The structure is clear: experience, projects, skills, and education.

## Why Single-Page Tabs

The tabbed format keeps navigation simple while still allowing depth.

- `Resume` is the primary section.
- `About` gives more personal context.
- `Writing` captures longer-form thinking over time.
- `Contact` stays easy to find.

## What I Will Improve Next

- Replace placeholders with quantified bullets.
- Add links to selected projects.
- Publish short technical reflections monthly.
